<p> Usually, CSS is written in a separate CSS file (with file extension .css) or in a <b>style</b> tag inside of the <b>head</b> tag, but there is a third place which is also valid. The third place you can write CSS is inside of an HTML tag, using the style attribute. When CSS is written using the <b>style</b> attribute, it’s called an “inline style”. In general, this is not considered a best practice. However, there are times when inline styles are the right (or only) choice..</p>
