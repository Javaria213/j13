        <p>Air pollution can be defined as an alteration of air quality that can be characterized by measurements of chemical, biological or physical pollutants in the air. Therefore, air pollution means the undesirable presence of impurities or the abnormal rise in the proportion of some constituents of the atmosphere. It can be classified in 2 sections: visible and invisible air pollution.

     	<p>Plastic pollution is caused by the accumulation of plastic waste in the environment. It can be categorized in primary plastics, such as cigarette butts and bottle caps, or secondary plastics, resulting from the degradation of the primary ones. It can also be defined by its size, from microplastics - small particles (5 mm) of plastic dispersed in the environment - to macroplastics.

    	<h3>Land pollution </h3>
    	Land pollution is the deterioration of the earth’s land surfaces, often directly or indirectly as a result of man’s activities and their misuse of land resources.
It occurs when waste is not disposed of properly, or can occur when humans throw chemicals onto the soil in the form of pesticides, insecticides and fertilizers during agricultural practices. Exploitation of minerals has also contributed to the destruction of the earth’s surface.
